Vareid - a simple Pelican theme
###############################

Vareid is a simple Pelican theme motivated by my personal page
``jorgenabrahamsen.com``, but can easily be used as is or as a starting point for
your own theme.

Setup
-----
This template requires you to download Ionicons 2 and Bootstrap 3 css. 
Please refer to ``base.html`` for how these are included in the template.

Note that this theme uses a page as its landing page/``index.html``. This is
achieved by saving a page as index.html with the help of the ``save_as``
metadata.

A good tip for playing freely with the content of the index.html is to not
specify any title and to use the raw data passthrough found in
reStructuredText's markup: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#raw-data-pass-through
